    "\"w\" (write mode) - opens the file for writing. If the file exists, its contents will be truncated and overwritten.\n",
    "If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\"a\" (append mode) - opens the file for writing, but data is appended to the end of the file if it already exists.\n",

    "Releasing resources: When a file is opened, system resources are allocated for it. By closing the file,\n",
    "you release those resources back to the system, making them available for other processes.\n",

    "ensuring that the data is saved.\n",

    "Preventing data corruption: If a file is not closed properly, it may result in data corruption or other issues. For example,\n",
    "if your program crashes or terminates before the file is closed, the file may be left in an inconsistent state,\n",
